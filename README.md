# Blog v2

My personal project blog at [jemgunay.co.uk](https://jemgunay.co.uk), built with Hugo
using [CaiJimmy's Stack theme](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). This is a migration of
my [original](https://github.com/jemgunay/blog) and deprecated PHP blog.

## Maintaining

Run locally (first ensure hugo CLI is installed):

```shell
make run
```

Official theme docs [here](https://stack.jimmycai.com/guide/).
