"<p>See the GitHub repository <strong><a href=""https://github.com/jemgunay/echo-blinds"" target=""_blank"">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I created an Amazon Alexa skill server in Golang for controlling window blinds. It works by receiving instructions from Alexa utterances, which in turn trigger motors controlled via a Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO pins. These motors then pull the window blinds cords to rotate and pull them open. The motors and blinds cords were mounted to a 3D printed chassis, of which the models were precisely designed in Blender.</p>
