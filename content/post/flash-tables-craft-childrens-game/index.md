"<p>My little brother and sister (aged 7 and 8 at the time) wanted a more motivational way to practice their times tables for their school homework. They are obsessed with the popular game Minecraft, so I combined the two!</p>
<br>
<ul style=""list-style-type:square"">
  <li><p>Options to select multiple tables to practice with randomised question order.</p></li>
  <li><p>Optional timer to speed up the pace of a game.</p></li>
  <li><p>Summary at the end with correctly and incorrectly answered questions with their solutions.</p></li>
  <li><p>Characters from the game pop in and out at random areas and timings around the screen, with sounds and textures from the game recycled throughout.</p></li>
</ul>
