My little brother and sister (aged 7 and 8 at the time) wanted a more motivational way to practice their times tables
for their school homework. They are obsessed with the popular game Minecraft, so I combined the two!

- Options to select multiple tables to practice with randomised question order.
- Optional timer to speed up the pace of a game.
- Summary at the end with correctly and incorrectly answered questions with their solutions.
- Characters from the game pop in and out at random areas and timings around the screen, with sounds and textures from
  the game recycled throughout.
