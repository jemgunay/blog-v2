This is one of the first large projects I worked on when starting out with AS3. I worked on this with two friends; I
wrote the code, Matty created the majority of the graphics and Reuben provided ideas and tested the game. I wanted to
read into multiplayer game development so took a look at [Player.IO](https://playerio.com). By writing AS3 client side
code and C# server side code tests, I implemented the API with a basic blocky terrain generation algorithm I had been
working on to create a basic multiplayer base. We then decided to expand on this by creating a Minecraft/Terraria
inspired side-scroller with dwarves who explore and destroy the terrain.

Although basic and occasionally buggy, it has a great deal of character and I'm proud to call it a first major completed 
project.
