Simple use of recursion to make a warped tunnelling effect with circles using [Processing](https://processing.org/).
Processing sketch/source and compiled executable can be found below.

- Starts off slowly iterating over the four different rendering modes.
- Use keys 1, 2, 3 and 4 to change the visual/render mode (dynamic rainbow, static rainbow, dynamic greyscale, static
  greyscale).
- Use left and right arrow keys to switch to a different motion path (there are 4 motion paths, each with varied use of
  the trigonometric functions sin, cos and tan).
