"<p>See the GitHub repository <strong><a href=""https://github.com/jemgunay/procedural-game"" target=""_blank"">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I was keen to apply my Golang experience to the world of game development, of which I'd explored in several other languages. I came across the <a href=""https://github.com/faiface/pixel"" target=""_blank"">Pixel</a> 2D game library and wanted to combine it with the powerful concurrency model and networking packages that Go provides out of the box. The result was a multiplayer procedural terrain game consisting of:</p>

<ul style=""list-style-type:square"">
   <li><p>A seedable procedural world generator implemented with Perlin noise. Worlds consist of grassy mainland, bodies of water, sandy beaches, and a dynamically generated road network.</p></li>
   <li><p>Ability to host multiplayer worlds for other players to join.</p></li>
   <li><p>A basic weapons inventory and ammo system, with the ability to shoot other players.</p></li>
   <li><p>A flexible and responsive menu system with buttons, text inputs and scroll bars.</p></li>
   <li><p>Water wave shaders.</p></li>
</ul>
