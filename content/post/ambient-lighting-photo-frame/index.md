I wanted to make a photo frame gift more interesting, so added an ambient lighting effect by attaching a
small circuit to the back of the frame. Initially powered by an Arduino Uno, the C++ code controlling the timing of the
RGB LEDs was recompiled for an ATtiny45 microcontroller (enabling AA battery power) to significantly reduced the
projectâ€™s physical size, cost, and power consumption. The red, green, and blue LEDs can produce a smooth transition
across most of the visible light spectrum with vibrant intensity which refracts nicely to illuminate the glass frame and
backdrop.
