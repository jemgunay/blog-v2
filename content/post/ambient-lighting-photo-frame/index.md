"<p>I wanted to make a photo frame more interesting to give as a gift, so created an ambient lighting effect at the back of the frame using a small circuit which was originally powered by an Arduino Uno. The C++ code which handles the timing of the different coloured LEDs was then recompiled for an ATtiny45 microcontroller in order to reduce the overall scale, cost and wasted power consumption. There are red, green and blue LEDs allowing the display of the majority of the visible light spectrum in a smooth transition with vivid intensity.</p>
